## Long-Term Vision

I want to contribute to building intelligent systems that move beyond the transformer paradigm.  
Current LLMs are powerful, but scaling alone can’t solve their limitations in:

- long-term memory  
- consistent reasoning  
- representational flexibility  
- architectural interpretability  

My goal is to explore architectures with different inductive biases — models capable of new forms of reasoning and intelligence that current methods cannot reach.

I’m currently preparing for the EMAI Master’s Programme — focusing on Intelligent Decision-Making and the future of alternative AI architectures.  
If you’re working on systems, LLMs, or post-transformer research, I’d love to connect.
