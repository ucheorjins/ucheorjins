# Hi, I'm Uche — AI Engineer | LLM Systems | Intelligent Decision-Making

I build intelligent systems that combine robust machine learning foundations with practical LLM engineering.  
My journey spans the full evolutionary chain of modern AI from classical models to enterprise-scale LLM integrations.

## What I Do

### Intelligent Systems & LLM Engineering  
- Build document-aware question-answering agents  
- Design PDF intelligence pipelines with switchable inference engines  
- Integrate LLMs into enterprise workflows (KPMG Africa)  
- Build tools that combine backend intelligence with human-centered interaction patterns  


### Data-Driven Product Development  
- Web3 tooling & analytics
- Built natural-language interfaces for querying financial and on-chain data  
- Helped shape the strategy of the #1 token on the Aptos blockchain using data insights

## Long-Term Vision

I want to contribute to building intelligent systems that move beyond the transformer paradigm.  
Current LLMs are powerful, but scaling alone can’t solve their limitations in:

- long-term memory  
- consistent reasoning  
- representational flexibility  
- architectural interpretability  

My goal is to explore architectures with different inductive biases — models capable of new forms of reasoning and intelligence that current methods cannot reach.

## My Approach

I treat AI as **systems**, not isolated algorithms:

**ML Foundation → HCI-informed usability → Workflow integration → Intelligent LLM systems → Research vision**

This perspective lets me design solutions that perform well *and* support real human decision-making.

I’m currently preparing for the EMAI Master’s Programme — focusing on Intelligent Decision-Making and the future of alternative AI architectures.  
If you’re working on systems, LLMs, or post-transformer research, I’d love to connect.
